# Productivity Valley

**Productivity Valley** is a productivity website that combines the Pomodoro technique with a charming pixel art farming game. Complete Pomodoro sessions to grow crops, earn coins, and upgrade your farm. This project was designed collaboratively by a team of 5 students during our first year of university.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript ([Phaser.js](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser))
- **Backend**: Django, SQlite
- **Art**: Original artwork created using [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite), furniture assets sourced from an [online artist](https://penzilla.itch.io/top-down-retro-interior).

## Features

### Pomodoro Sessions
- Engage in 25-minute Pomodoro sessions to boost focus and productivity, or select a custom duration that fits your workflow.
- Each Pomodoro session is tied to the growth of crops in the game, creating a fun and motivating experience.
