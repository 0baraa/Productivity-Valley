this might be late, but we've spent far too long on this to not submit something that works. and this does work.

to run this you're going to need to install Django 5.0.3. note the version name.

this might be a problem, but good luck to you anyway

oh and everything in the requirements.txt in restart.


(use a venv if u're not)

if you get any build errors. well good luck debugging them.

but once it works,
run- $python3 manage.py runserver

from within the first 'restart' directory

u can go to 127.0.0.1:8000 and create a new account.

(or login as guest)

to see what we've done.
